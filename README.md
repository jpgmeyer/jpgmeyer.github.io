>I approach work and process information in my own way, which shapes how I think, communicate, and collaborate. My strengths come with challenges, so I use specific strategies to stay organized and aligned. This “personal README” outlines how I work best and where I might need support.

# My strengths

## Curiosity

I’m naturally curious and love exploring new topics, learning new skills, and diving into unfamiliar areas. This curiosity fuels creativity and a fresh perspective on problems.

## Collaborative mindset

Teamwork energizes me. I prioritize collaboration and shared success over competition. If you’re stuck, I’m always happy to help brainstorm and find solutions.

## Adaptability and resilience

I adapt quickly to change, making me comfortable in shifting priorities or unexpected challenges.

# My weaknesses

## Focus

Sustaining focus over long periods can be difficult. Clear tasks, structured deadlines, and occasional check-ins (like a quick “Are we on track?”) help keep me aligned.

## Hyperfocus

I sometimes get so immersed in tasks that I lose sight of other priorities. Gentle nudges help me balance.

## Overcommitment

I often say “yes” too much, drawn by curiosity and a desire to help. If my workload looks heavy, a reminder to reprioritize is valuable.

# How I work

## Communication

I appreciate clear, straightforward communication. Subtle cues or indirect feedback can miss the mark—let me know directly if adjustments are needed.

When messaging (e.g., on Slack), stating the request upfront helps me respond promptly.

I prefer written communication over voice memos or unscheduled calls. For discussions, scheduling a call in advance helps me prepare and contribute effectively.

## Collaboration

Teamwork energizes me, and I focus on collaboration and shared success over competition. If you’re stuck, I’d love to help think things through.

## Meetings

My calendar is always current, and I’m typically available for meetings from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. CET (2 a.m. to 1 p.m. ET). I can adjust for customer-facing meetings outside these hours when necessary.

Action items or summaries in writing after meetings help me stay organized and aligned.

## Time management

I rely on timers, checklists, and breaking tasks into manageable steps. Early deadline notices help me plan effectively.

# How to give me feedback

I value direct, constructive input. Point out areas for improvement—I’m here to grow.

- **Be specific:** Use clear examples (e.g., “I noticed X during Y”) to make feedback actionable.
- **Be timely:** Share feedback soon after an event to keep it relevant and effective.

I’ll reflect, adapt, and welcome follow-ups to track progress.
