# Leverage my strengths

I excel at creative problem-solving and connecting ideas others might miss. Bring me into complex challenges or brainstorming sessions when fresh perspectives are needed.

# Help me stay focused

Long stretches of focus can be tough for me. Clear tasks, structured deadlines, and gentle check-ins help keep me aligned. A quick “Are we on track?” works wonders if I seem distracted.

# Clear, written instructions work best

I rely on detailed, written action items to stay organized and avoid misunderstandings. Verbal input is fine, but a follow-up email or document ensures clarity. Summarizing key tasks or next steps after meetings keeps me aligned.

# Be direct in communication

I appreciate clear, straightforward communication. Subtle cues or indirect feedback may not land, so let me know directly if adjustments are needed—I value feedback and strive to improve.

When messaging me (e.g., on Slack), stating your request upfront helps me respond quickly.

# Understand my hyperfocus

When deeply immersed in a task, I can lose track of time or other priorities. A gentle nudge can help me recalibrate.

# Time management strategies help

I use tools like timers and checklists to stay on track. Breaking projects into smaller steps and early notice of deadlines make planning smoother.

# Collaborate with me

Teamwork energizes me, and I focus on collaboration and shared success over competition. If you’re stuck, I’d love to help think things through.

# Feedback and understanding are welcome

Constructive feedback helps me grow. If you have concerns or ideas for improvement, I’m eager to hear them.
