  <p>I approach work and process information in my own way, which shapes how I think, communicate, and collaborate. My strengths come with challenges, so I use specific strategies to stay organized and aligned. This “personal README” outlines how I work best and where I might need support.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="my-strengths">My strengths</h1>

<h2 id="curiosity">Curiosity</h2>

<p>I’m naturally curious and love exploring new topics, learning new skills, and diving into unfamiliar areas. This curiosity fuels creativity and a fresh perspective on problems.</p>

<h2 id="collaborative-mindset">Collaborative mindset</h2>

<p>Teamwork energizes me. I prioritize collaboration and shared success over competition. If you’re stuck, I’m always happy to help brainstorm and find solutions.</p>

<h2 id="adaptability-and-resilience">Adaptability and resilience</h2>

<p>I adapt quickly to change, making me comfortable in shifting priorities or unexpected challenges.</p>

<h1 id="my-weaknesses">My weaknesses</h1>

<h2 id="focus">Focus</h2>

<p>Sustaining focus over long periods can be difficult. Clear tasks, structured deadlines, and occasional check-ins (like a quick “Are we on track?”) help keep me aligned.</p>

<h2 id="hyperfocus">Hyperfocus</h2>

<p>I sometimes get so immersed in tasks that I lose sight of other priorities. Gentle nudges help me balance.</p>

<h2 id="overcommitment">Overcommitment</h2>

<p>I often say “yes” too much, drawn by curiosity and a desire to help. If my workload looks heavy, a reminder to reprioritize is valuable.</p>

<h1 id="how-i-work">How I work</h1>

<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

<p>I appreciate clear, straightforward communication. Subtle cues or indirect feedback can miss the mark—let me know directly if adjustments are needed.</p>

<p>When messaging (e.g., on Slack), stating the request upfront helps me respond promptly.</p>

<p>I prefer written communication over voice memos or unscheduled calls. For discussions, scheduling a call in advance helps me prepare and contribute effectively.</p>

<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>

<p>Teamwork energizes me, and I focus on collaboration and shared success over competition. If you’re stuck, I’d love to help think things through.</p>

<h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>

<p>My calendar is always current, and I’m typically available for meetings from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. CET (2 a.m. to 1 p.m. ET). I can adjust for customer-facing meetings outside these hours when necessary.</p>

<p>Action items or summaries in writing after meetings help me stay organized and aligned.</p>

<h2 id="time-management">Time management</h2>

<p>I rely on timers, checklists, and breaking tasks into manageable steps. Early deadline notices help me plan effectively.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-give-me-feedback">How to give me feedback</h1>

<p>I value direct, constructive input. Point out areas for improvement—I’m here to grow.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> Use clear examples (e.g., “I noticed X during Y”) to make feedback actionable.</li>
  <li><strong>Be timely:</strong> Share feedback soon after an event to keep it relevant and effective.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll reflect, adapt, and welcome follow-ups to track progress.</p>

<hr />

<p>Thanks for taking the time to understand how I work!</p>
